# Mozilla Onboarding
14 - 16 October 2015

## Biographical Info:

###Early Days:

* Name: Joey Lee
* Born & raised: SF Bay Area
* Parents are Korean Immigrants (landed '80s)
* Major influences: Skateboarding, photography, art - making skate film / Eurotrip (2008)

### 2008 - 2012
* Entered UCLA to study Fine Art, but ventured out and in the end fell into Geography/Environmental Studies.
* A few major things happened during undergrad: 
	* fell in love with research and exploration in general, 
	* specifically, became interested in cities and their impact on the environment (in large part connected with my experiences as a skateboarder),
	* I found technology to be particularly intriguing, especially those around making maps via GIS, Remote Sensing, and programming. 
	* Did field work in Puerto Rico for my undergrad thesis and spent a semester in Paris, France, and another semester in the Brazilian Amazon.
* additionally: worked at Transworld Skate Magazine as a copy editor intern - childhood dream come true!

### 2012 - 2013
* Upon receiving my rejection to teach english in France, I applied and was accepted as a RA at the MIT Senseable City Lab a week after completeing my undergrad.
* Worked on a number of exciting projects - Hubcab was a fun one. 
* Most importantly, met my now close friend and mentor, Benedikt GroÃŸ who was also an RA for the summer during his MA at the RCA in London. From that point on, the lines between art, science, and design have become extremely fuzzy - we started the Big Atlas of LA Pools after a simple lunchtime conversation... how many pools are in LA?
* Spent 10 months working in Singapore as part of the Lab's Singapore research Initiative (Live! Singapore) where it became clear I wanted to pursue a MSc. 
* Made lots of great friends in particular, Brian Jacobs (who during our time there also applied and was accepted as a Mozilla Knight Fellow).


### 2013 - Current
* Started a MSc at UBC in Vancouver with Andreas Christen - the best supervisor ever.
* My thesis project idea was born out of my first committee meeting - can we map a city's greenhouse gas emissions with a network of mobile sensors? 
* Up until this point, I had only dabbled programming in python, but after a course in R, countless hours pouring over other peoples' html/css/javascript code, more python, and Processing, I became hooked! At the same time, it was clear that our mobile sensors would also be made with Arduino bits, so I was in a sort of heaven of technologies.
* The last 2 years have just been a super exciting hackathon, building sensors, testing them, breaking things, and coding things 
* Also: Kickstarter - Aerial Bold Project
* Also lots of traveling: Tokyo, Japan - JMAF (2014), Stuttgart, Germany (RA with Benedikt/47Nord), Toulouse, France (ICUC conference), SF, USA (AGU conference), Chicago, USA (next week for Aerial Bold)
* Now Mozilla!

## Sources of Inspiration
### Science/Art/Design
* Global Climate Uncertainty - we have to do something!!
* Urban climate community - Tim Oke, Andreas, many others!
* Open science and open data community
* Speculative Design / Computational Design  / Interaction Design
* Processing Foundation/P5.js
* MIT Media Lab, RCA DI (RIP), UCLA DMA, Stamen Design
* Open Vis Conference, FOSS4G, KIKK, JMAF
* Viz community
* Books! Twitter! THE WEB!

##your take on open science
* Open science has given me agency to make my ideas tangible, allowing me to focus more on my research questions and less on the technical details. By having access to open software (e.g. ) and hardware (e.g. Arduino) and a global community of scientists, designers, and artists, I have been able to contribute to rather than reinvent what has already been done. Open science has ultimately given me the ability to to turn data into knowledge and something that is actionable at policy relevant scales.

##your projects 
* Current:
	* Thesis: Mapping CO2 Emissions in Complex Environments--> car2go/Moovel collab
	* Aerial Bold
	* Teaching: GEOB472
	* Personal Projects:
		* I saw you
		* border wait times viz	
	* Startup days ...
* Past:
	* Big Atlas of LA Pools
	* MIT: Boston 3-1-1, Hubcab, Live! Singapore
	

***
##main blocking points you face
* The gap! There's a gap... **between my ideas and what the skills that I have to make those ideas tangible**.
* The university moves slow, fruaght with internal politics.
* getting "buy in" to the cultural aspects - the big question mark is: how do we get participation and immersion into the culture of openness?

##goals for fellowship

### Questions
* I'm interested at the latter part of the scientific pipeline - what do people do with their research? and how do they get it out to the public? 
	* how can technology, particularly the web, be leveraged to facilitate communication? How do we develop literacy around the tools and methods to get science out and into the world? 
	* How do we bring together people -- scientists, artists, & designers -- to breath life into research outside of science?
	* what is the best metaphor for teaching?
* Access to experimental/experiential learning - innaugural class!
* Access to Mozilla network - people doing science but also recognizing the importance of communication, outreach, and literacy in technology to do all those wonderful things.
* Flexbility to come up with 1 solid project + do workshops + continue doing my science
* Opportunity to focus on web technologies and visualization - build up my skills as a technologist. 
* Learn to tidy up my workflow and get better at contributing - when you have to teach, it forces you to structure your thoughts!


### Objectives
* Learn, learn, learn
* coding skills 
* communication and teaching skills
* cultural development
