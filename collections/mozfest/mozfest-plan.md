Who we are ? Opening the circles of teams, introducing the layers to MoFo, Mozfest and community
Managing expectaions from both sides
---> use similar language as wrangler onboarding
Community + culture - this is a really diverse group for many / all. Principles about respect, how to be inclusive, etc, would help. That they're emblematic of that culture through the festival (and beyond).

THURSDAY MOFO ALL-HANDS AGENDA

Prep:
Comment on each session about why we're doing each exercise
VPs as distributed note takers per small groups as "active listeners"
Put up posters and materials

MC (Claw)

Welcome (Mark). Overt talking points that will be repeated in each circle:

1. Build and connect leaders. How? A leadership network. 
Mozilla is dedicated to convening and connecting people — from executives to young community leaders — who share our cause. 
This is our leadership network. Everyone here is a core member of this network and represents even larger communities back home. 
We want to facilitate collaboration within our network. We want to serve people working on projects where they teach, organize and hack with peers. We want to support you as you learn and refine open practices and become stronger leaders along the way. 
For 2016, we're focusing on how to increase the cohesion and impact of the network. 
Today we invite you to reflect on your involvement with the network so far and to set an intention for how you'd like to continue contributing to it -- at Mozfest and beyond. Use this purpose to guide your participation this weekend. 
2. Rally citizens to our common cause. How? An advocacy engine. 
Mozilla is dedicated to activating more people in service to the web -- rallying citizens to take action for the open internet.
These advocacy efforts include everything from attending local ‘teach-ins’ to signing a petition to donating to our shared cause. Many of you here have contributed greatly to these efforts already, be that our grassroots Maker Party learning campaign, mass mobilization around issues like net neutrality, and engaging in public conversation about web literacy.
We want to invite more people into taking action for the web. This means continuing to advance a "read, write, participate" web, as well as taking a stand in new issues as they arise.
For 2016, we're focusing on identifying and prioritizing the issues we want to take on. Web literacy is definitely one of them. Privacy, walled gardens and the economics of the public internet are also on the list. 
Today we invite you to reflect on the issues you're passionate about and to consider how we could take action -- at Mozfest and beyond. Use this purpose to guide your participation this weekend.
3. Towards: Fueling the movement to drive the next wave of open. 
Strengthen our thought leadership.
Mozfest is where the movement gains fuel--by convening & growing our leadership network and working to rally more citizens to our common cause. Mozfest is where you can see this strategic plan in action as well as contribute your actions to drive it forward.
