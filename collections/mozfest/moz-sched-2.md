 https://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/2015/10/26/course-description-for-the-open-science-and-reproducible-research-course-for-bug-counters-people-that-count-other-things-too/
Course description is now crunching through the gears of the grad program committee, I should be able to advertise it next week!
Discussed this paper at Lab meeting http://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-and-how-they-can-stop-1.18517
Didn't get deported, obtained Canadian chocolate.
Put together presentation for Entomological Society of America meeting (Minneapolis, Nov 15-18) wherein I show entomologists some work where I used #otherpeoplesdata from several sources to solve a pest-control mystery!

Joey:
